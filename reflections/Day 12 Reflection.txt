# Day 12 Reflection

The governance room helped me understand the legal backbone of cybersecurity. Now I understand why companies follow things like GDPR and PCI-DSS.

My CLI lab was much deeper today. I learned not just how to run commands like ping and netstat, but why they matter and how they're used in real-world troubleshooting or threat hunting.

The GenAI lesson opened my mind to practical tools I could integrate into a SOC environment.

And today marked the launch of my first cybersecurity + AI project.
