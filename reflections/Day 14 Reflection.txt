# Day 14 – Reflection

Today’s focus was on understanding how attackers break into networks and how defenders block them. The Google course helped me grasp real intrusion methods like port scanning, and how denial-of-service attacks can take down entire services. I now see how layered network defense works and why IDS and segmentation are so important.

TryHackMe introduced me to Google Dorking and passive OSINT techniques, which felt powerful—like digital reconnaissance. I learned how attackers gather info without ever touching the system.

The Linux lab helped me solidify how Linux systems control access with permissions and sudo. Each command gave me hands-on knowledge I can use in real forensic or system-hardening scenarios.

I feel like today was a major turning point. I now understand more clearly how attackers think and how I can defend against them.
