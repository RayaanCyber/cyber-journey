# TryHackMe â€“ Cyber Kill Chain

## The 7 Stages:
1. Reconnaissance: discovering and collecting information on the system and the victim
2. Weaponization: combines malware and exploit into a deliverable payload
3. Delivery: method for transmitting the payload or the malware
4. Exploitation: exploit the vulnerability to gain access to the system
5. Installation: installing the threat
6. Command & Control: remotely control and manipulate the victim
7. Actions on Objectives: taking action on the original objectives

## Cyber Application:
- Mapping attacker behavior
- Defenders use it to identify breach points and improve detection

## Practical Value:
- Understand where detection tools (IDS, antivirus) fit in
- Useful for building your own SOC playbooks
