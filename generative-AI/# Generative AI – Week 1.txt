# Generative AI – Module 1: What is Generative AI?

## What It Is:
- AI that generates new high quality content: text, code, images, sound
- Examples: ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, DALL·E, ElevenLabs

## Use Cases:
- Email replies
- Marketing copy
- Code generation
- Data summarization

## Key Technologies:
- Large Language Models (LLMs) & Supervised Learning
- Neural networks and transformers

## How LLMs Work:
- Built by using Supervised Learning (Input A -> Output B) to repeatedly predit the next word
- When large AI system is trained on a lot of data, we get a LLM like Chatgpt

## Web-Based vs Software App Use of LLMs:
- Web-based: Chatgpt, Bard, Bing Chat
- Software-Based: email routing, document search

## Risks:
- Hallucinations: AI confidently making up facts
- Bias: reflects bad data if not trained ethically
