# Generative AI â€“ Week 2, Part 1: Software Applications

### Key Points:
- GenAI is being integrated into tools people already use every day
- It powers smart replies, email drafts, document formatting, etc.
- Companies like Google, Microsoft, and Notion have embedded AI into their platforms

### Examples:
- Gmail: Suggests full email responses or rephrases tone
- Notion AI: Summarizes meeting notes, rewrites paragraphs
- GitHub Copilot: Converts comments into real-time code

## Lifecycle of a Generative AI Project

### 6 Stages of a GenAI Project:
1. Problem Definition: Identify a task that can benefit from GenAI (e.g., email summarizing)
2. Data Collection: Ensure enough clean data is available to train or prompt effectively
3. Model Selection: Choose a model appropriate for your task (text, image, code, etc.)
4. Prompt Design: Write effective instructions to get useful output
5. Testing & Iteration: Experiment, refine prompts, and validate model behavior
6. Deployment & Monitoring: Integrate into your software and track results in the real world

## Cost Intuition

### What Increases Cost:
- Longer prompts (more tokens = more cost)
- Multiple rounds of prompting (iterations, retries)
- Larger models (like GPT-4 or Claude Opus) cost more per token than smaller ones

### Ways to Optimize:
- Shorten prompts without losing clarity
- Use summarization tools to preprocess content
- Use cheaper models when possible for less critical tasks
