# Day 12 CLI Lab – ping, netstat, ss

## Objective:
To demonstrate the use of essential Linux networking tools for host availability testing, open port detection, and socket inspection.

## 1. ping google.com -c 4

### Purpose:
- Sends 4 ICMP echo requests to Google’s IP
- Verifies DNS resolution and measures response time

### Why It Matters:
- First step in troubleshooting any network issue
- Confirms connectivity and DNS functionality

### Example Use Case:
- A user can't reach a site, run ping to see if the server is reachable or if the problem is local

## 2. netstat -tuln

### Purpose:
- Displays all listening TCP/UDP ports in numeric form
- Flags:  
  - `t` = TCP  
  - `u` = UDP  
  - `l` = Listening  
  - `n` = Numeric (no DNS lookup)

### Why It Matters:
- Lets you see which services are currently running and which ports they’re using
- Commonly used during vulnerability assessments

### Example Use Case:
- You’re auditing a system to check if insecure services (e.g., telnet, FTP) are running and listening

## 3. ss -tuln

### Purpose:
- Replacement for `netstat`; faster and more reliable on modern systems
- Shows the same data but with faster output and more filtering options

### Why It Matters:
- Used in production systems for socket diagnostics and live traffic snapshots
- Good practice to use `ss` in newer Linux environments

### Example Use Case:
- You’re in a SOC and need a live snapshot of all open ports, `ss` gives you instant feedback
