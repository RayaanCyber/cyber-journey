# Day 14 – Kali Linux CLI Lab: File Permissions & Sudo

## ls -l
Reveals rwx (read/write/execute) flags for user, group, and others. Used to audit file access.

## chmod 755
Grants full control to the file owner, and read/execute to everyone else. Common for executable scripts.

## chown root:root
Changes the file’s owner to root. Used when protecting critical system files from unauthorized edits.

## id
Shows your UID, GID, and group memberships. Helps confirm privileges or access levels.

## sudo whoami
Shows whether sudo works by temporarily switching to root. Real-world test for privilege escalation.

## Why This Matters
Linux permission errors are a common source of both misconfigurations and vulnerabilities. Mastery of these tools is essential for hardening systems.
