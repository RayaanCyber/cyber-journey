# DNS Recon Lab â€“ whois, dig, nslookup

## Why This Lab?

- Simulates reconnaissance phase from both red team and blue team perspectives
- Teaches how attackers gather intelligence and how defenders assess exposure


## `whois`:
- Gets registrar info, contact details, DNS servers
- Use: See who owns the domain, expiration status, or if WHOIS privacy is active

## `dig`:
- Pulls DNS records (A, TXT, MX, etc.)
- Use: Check email servers, subdomain visibility, or identify vulnerable TXT configs

## `nslookup`:
- Simple domain resolution + name server check
- Use: Ensure DNS is resolving correctly; test alternate DNS servers
