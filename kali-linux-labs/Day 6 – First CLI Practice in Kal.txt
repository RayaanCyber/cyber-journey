# Day 6 â€“ First CLI Practice in Kali Linux

## Commands Practiced:

```bash
whoami
uname -r
cat /etc/os-release
pwd
ls -la
mkdir day6-lab
cd day6-lab
touch testfile.txt
echo "This is my first Kali Linux lab" > testfile.txt
cat testfile.txt
history

- pwd: shows current directory
- ls -la: lists files, including hidden ones
- mkdir: creates directories
