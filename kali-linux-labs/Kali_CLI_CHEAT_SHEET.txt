ss -tuln              # Modern alternative to netstat

## 🔍 Scanning Tools

nmap -sV scanme.nmap.org        # Scan target for open ports + service versions
nmap -A scanme.nmap.org         # Aggressive scan: OS detect, scripts, traceroute

## 📦 Package Management

sudo apt update        # Refresh package lists
sudo apt upgrade       # Install all updates
sudo apt install tool  # Install tool (e.g., nmap)
