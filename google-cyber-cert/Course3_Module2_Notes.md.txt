# Course 3 â€“ Module 2: Protocols & System Identification

## Network Protocols
- set of rules used by 2 or more devices on a network to describe the order of delivery/structure of data

# Key Protocols
- Transmission Control Protocol (TCP): allows 2 devices to form connection and stream data 
- Address Resolution Protocol (ARP): determines MAC address of the next router or device on the path
- Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS): provides secure method of communication between clients and website servers
- Domain Name System (DNS): translates internet domain names into IP addresses
- User Datagram Protocol (UDP): connectionless protocol that is much faster than TCP but no delivery is guaranteed
- Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP): used for monitoring and managing devices on a network
- Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP): used by devices to tell each other about data transmission errors/diagnostics

## Firewalls
- monitors traffic to and from network

# Port Filtering: firewall function that allows/blocks certain port numbers to limit unwanted communication

# Stateful: class of firewall that keeps track of information passing through, proactively filters out threats

# Stateless: operates based on predefined rules, does not keep track of info from data packets

## VPN
- network security service that changes public IP address and hides virtual location to keep data private on public network

# Encapsulation: process performed by VPN to protect data by wrapping sensitive data in other data packets

## Security Zones
- segment of network that protects internal networks from the internet

# Network Segmentation: security technique that divides network into segments

# Uncontrolled Zone: any network outside organizations control
  
# Controlled Zone: subnet that protects the internal network from uncontrolled zone

## Proxy Server
- server that fulfills the requests of client by forwarding them to other servers

# Forward Proxy Server: regulates/restricts a persons access to the internet 

# Reverse Proxy Server: regulates/restricts internets access to internal server
