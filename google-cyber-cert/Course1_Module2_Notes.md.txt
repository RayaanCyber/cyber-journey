# Course 1 â€“ Module 2: The Evolution of Cybersecurity

## How the internet evolved
- designed for communication, not security
- TCP/IP protocols assume trust 

## Notable Cyber Attacks
- Morris Worm (1988): First large-scale worm
- Target Breach (2013): Stolen vendor credentials
- Equifax (2017): Failed to patch vulnerability
- Colonial Pipeline (2021): Ransomware caused major infrastructure shutdown

## Common Attacks & Their Effectiveness
- Types of Phishing
	1. Spear Phishing (malicious email targeting specific group/people)
	2. Business Email Compromise (email seems to be from familiar source to obtain financial advantage)
	3. Whaling (target company executives)
	4. Vishing (exploiting voice communication)
	5. Smishing (use of texts)

- Types of Malware
	1. Virus (malicious code written to interfere with operations/cause damage to data or software)
	2. Worm (self-replicating malware. in contrast to virus, does not need to be downloaded by user)
	3. Ransomware (attack that encrypts data and demands payment to restore access)
	4. Spyware (used to gather and sell info without consent)

- Types of Social Engineering
	1. Social Media Phishing (threat actor collects detailed info about target from social media)
	2. Watering Hole (attacks website frequently visited by specific group of people)
	3. USB Baiting (actor strategically places USB for employee to find/install)
	4. Physical (impersonation of employee, customers, vendors)

## 8 CISSP Security Domains
1. Security and Risk Management - security goals/objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, the law
2. Asset Security - secures digital/physical assets. related to the storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data
3. Security Architecture and Engineering - optimization of data security (eg. firewall, effective tools)
4. Communication and Network Security - Manage/secure physical networks/wireless comm.
5. Identity and Access Management - keeping data secure by following policies/manage physical assets
6. Security Assessment and Testing - conducting security audits for risks, threats, vulnerabilities
7. Security Operations - implementing preventative measures
8. Software Development Security - secure coding practices, recommended guidelines for secure apps/services

## Modern Threats
- AI-generated scams
- Deepfakes
- Nation-wide threat actors
- Zero-day vulnerabilities (flaw in software discovered by attackers before developers knowledge)
