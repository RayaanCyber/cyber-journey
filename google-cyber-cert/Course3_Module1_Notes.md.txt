# Course 3 â€“ Module 1: Intro to Networks

## What Is a Network?
- A collection of devices connected to share resources.
- Includes: routers, switches, firewalls, servers, endpoints

## Network Types:
- Local Area Network (LAN): network spans a small area (home, office)
- Wide Area Network (WAN): spans large area (city)

## Network Tools:
- Hub: network device that broadcasts info to every device on network
- Switch: device that connects specific devices on network by sending/receiving data between them. More secure than hub
- Router: device connecting multiple networks together
- Modem: device connecting router to internet, brings access to LAN
- Wireless Access Point (WAP): sends/receives digital signals over radio waves creating a wireless network

## Cloud Service Provider (CSP)
- company that offers cloud computing services

## 3 categories of CSP:
- SaaS (Software as a service): company can use remotely without hosting software
- IaaS (Infrastructure as a service): offers virtual components like storage. Managed via API or web-console
- PaaS (Platform as a service): tools app designers can use to design custom apps for their company

## Benefits of Cloud Computing:
- Reliability: high availability, secure connections, consistent uptime for users/employees
- Cost: lower upfront costs thanks to CSP-managed infrastructure, pay-as-you-go model
- Scalability: easily scale resources up or down based on deman, only pay for what you need

## Network Communication
- Data Packet: basic unit of information that travels from one device to another on same network
- Speed: rate which data packets are received/downloaded
- Bandwidth: amount of data device receives every second
- Packet Sniffing: capturing/inspecting data packets

## TCP/IP Model
- connects computers world-wide
- TCP: internet communication protocol allowing two devices to form a connection/stream data
- IP: standards used for routing/addressing data packets as they travel between devices
- Port: software-based location that organizes the sending/receiving of data between devices on network

## Common Port Numbers:
- 25: email
- 443: secure internet communication
- 20: large file transfers

## Four Layers of TCP/IP Model
1. Network Access: handles physical transmission/local delivery (cables, MAC addresses, ARP)
2. Internet: routes packets across networks using IP, supports troubleshooting with ICMP
3. Transport: manages end-to-end communication using TCP (web-browsing) and UDP (video streaming)
4. Application: interface with user apps/services
