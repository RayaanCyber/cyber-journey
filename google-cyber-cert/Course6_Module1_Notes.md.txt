# Course 6 Module 1: Introduction to Detection and Incident Response

## Incident Response Lifecycle
- Identify → Protect → Detect → Respond → Recover

- Incident: occurrence that actually or imminently jeapordizes, without lawful authority, the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information or an information system; or constitutes a violation or imminent threat of violation of law, security policies, security procedures, or acceptable use policies
- Event: observable occurrence on a network, system, or device
- Incident Handlers Journal: documentation used in incident response

# The 5 W's of an Incident

1. WHO triggered the incident
2. WHAT happened
3. WHEN the incident took place
4. WHERE the incident took place
5. WHY the incident occurred

## Incident Response Teams

- Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRT): specialized group of security pro's that are trained in incident management/response

# NIST Incident Response Lifecycle (4 phases)

1. Preparation
2. Detection and Analysis
3. Containment, Eradication, and Recovery
4. Post-incident activity

# Key Roles in CSIRTs

- Security Analyst: continuously monitor environment for threats. Analyze and triage alerts, perform root-cause investigations, escalate or resolve alerts
- Technical Lead: manage all technical aspects of incident response. Determine root cause, create and implement strategies for containment, eradication and recovery
- Incident Coordinator: coordinate with relevant departments. Ensure clear communication with departments 

# Security Operations Center (SOC)

- organizational unit dedicated to monitoring networks, systems, and devices for security threats
- involved in blue team activities 
- organized into tiered structure

# SOC Roles

- SOC Analyst Tier 1: initial alert monitoring and triage. Monitor, review, and prioritize alerts, create and close tickets, escalate tier 2/3
- SOC Analyst Tier 2: deeper investigation and refinement of tools. Receive escalated tickets, configure and refine security tools, report to SOC Lead
- SOC Lead Tier 3: managing team operations/advanced analysis. Manage team operations, explore new detection methods, perform malware and forensics analysis, report to SOC Manager
- SOC Manager: hiring, training, and evaluating SOC team members

## Incident Response Tools

# Detection Tools
- continuously monitor networks/systems for suspicious activity and trigger an alert to notify security professionals of a possible intrusion

# 3 Main Detection Tools

- Intrusion Detection System (IDS): monitors system activity/alerts on possible intrusions
- Goal: detect malicious activity and generate an alert
- Limitations: does not stop or prevent the activity
- Examples: Zeek, Suricata, Snort, Sagan

- Intrusion Prevention System (IPS): monitors system activity and takes action to stop the activity. Works similarly to IDS but also prevents activity to minimize effects

- Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR): monitors an endpoint for malicious activity
- Key Features: installed directly on endpoints. Collects, records, and analyzes endpoint data

# Detection Categories (IDS Alerts)

- True Positive: alert correctly detects the presence of an attack (GOOD)
- True Negative: no alert triggered because no malicious activity exists (GOOD)
- False Positive: alert incorrectly detects a threat (BAD)
- False Negative: malicious activity happens, but IDS fails to detect it (BAD)

## SOAR and SIEM Tools

- Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR): a collection of applications, tools, and workflows that uses automation to respond to security events

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM): application that collects/analyzes log data to monitor critical activities in organizations

# The SIEM Process

1. Collect/Aggregate Data: gathers log data from various sources. Consolidates all log data into a single, centralized location
2. Normalize Data: transforms raw data from different sources into a standard, structured format that is easily searchable
3. Analyze Data: applies detection logic to normalized data. Compares multiple log events to identify common patterns indicating potential threats

# Common SIEM Tools

- AlienVault, Chronicle, Elastic, Exabeam, IBM QRadar, LogRhythm, Splunk
