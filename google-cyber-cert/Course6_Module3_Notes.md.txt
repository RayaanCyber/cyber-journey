# Course 6 Module 3 - Incident Investigation and Response

## Detection Tools

- tools only detect what they are configured to monitor, making additional methods essential for increased coverage/accuracy
- IDS detects possible intrusions and sends alerts
- SIEM tools detect, collect, and analyze security data

## Threat Hunting

- proactive, human-driven search for threats on a network
- used to uncover malicious activity missed by tools
- use threat intelligence, Indicators of Compromise/Attack, and machine learning

## Threat Intelligence (TI)

- evidence-based threat information providing context about threats
- sources include industry reports, govt advisories, and threat data feeds
- Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP): collects, centralizes, analyzes TI from different sources

## Cyber Deception

- techniques that deliberately deceive malicious actors to increase detection and improve defenses
- Honeypots: decoy systems or resources created to appear vulnerable, attracting intruders, and alerting security teams when accessed

# Ongoing Monitoring of CI/CD

- Purpose: critical for protecting software supply chain by finding threats and IoC

## Common IoC

- Unauthorized Code Changes: changes by unapproved users, suspicious changes
- Suspicious Deployment Patterns: deployments to unapproved systems
- Compromised Dependencies: finding known vulnerabilities (CVEs)
- Unusual Pipeline Execution: sudden pipeline failures
- Secrets Exposure Attempts: logs showing attempts to access secrets

## Automated Methods for finding IoCs

- Pipeline Execution Logs: establish baseline of normal operation to flag deviations as potential IoC
- Code Commit Logs: monitor for unusual authors, times, suspicious content
- Access Logs: flag unusual logins
- Deployment Logs: identify deployments at odd times

- SIEM Integrations: used to find unusual patterns using machine learning
