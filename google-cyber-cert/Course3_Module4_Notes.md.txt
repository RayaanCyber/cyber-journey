# Google Cybersecurity â€“ Course 3, Module 4: Security Hardening

## What is Security Hardening?
Security hardening is the process of reducing vulnerabilities in systems, networks, or cloud environments by eliminating unnecessary features, securing configurations, and enforcing good practices.

## OS Hardening
- Disable unnecessary services and ports.
- Use complex passwords and lock guest accounts.
- Keep systems patched and logs enabled.
- Remove default admin accounts or rename them.

## Network Hardening
- Disable unused ports on routers, switches, and firewalls.
- Use secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS, SSH).
- Implement IDS/IPS to detect and block malicious traffic.
- Segment networks using VLANs or subnetting.

## Cloud Hardening
- Apply the principle of least privilege (use IAM roles).
- Enable encryption (in transit and at rest).
- Monitor activity via logging tools (like AWS CloudTrail).
- Enable MFA for all cloud administrators.

## Summary
Hardening prevents attackers from exploiting known weaknesses. These are proactive defense strategies used by security analysts, sysadmins, and penetration testers.
