# Google Cybersecurity â€“ Course 4, Module 3: Linux Commands in the Bash Shell

## What is Bash?
- Bash = Bourne Again Shell, the command-line interface used in Linux.
- Allows direct text-based control of system functions.

## Navigating the File System
- `pwd`: Shows current directory  
- `ls`: Lists contents of a directory  
- `cd`: Changes directory  
- `mkdir`: Creates a new folder  
- `touch`: Creates a blank file  
- `rm`: Removes files  
- `rmdir`: Removes empty folders

## Viewing File Contents
- `cat`: Prints entire file  
- `less` / `more`: Scroll through file output  
- `head` / `tail`: View first or last lines

## Searching
- `grep`: Searches inside files for keywords  
- `find`: Locates files and directories  
- `locate`: Searches file database (may need to run `sudo updatedb` first)

## Getting Help
- `man [command]`: Shows manual page  
- `[command] --help`: Displays quick help info

## File Permissions
- Permissions: type of access granted for file or directory
- Permissions are represented by 10 character string
- Read: read file control
- Write: make modifications
- Execute: execute files if they are programs
- Permissions are given to 3 types of owners: users, groups, other

# Viewing Permissions:
- ls with options
	- 'ls -a' = shows hidden files
	- 'ls -l' = shows permissions, owners, group, size, mod times
	- 'ls -la' = combines both

# Change Permissions with 'chmod'
chmod: adjusts permissions based on least privilege
Syntax: chmod [user][operator][permissions] filename
	- who: u (user), g (group), o (other)
	- operators: + (add), - (remove), = (set capacity)
	- permissions: r, w, x

## Add/Delete Users
sudo: allows temp elevated privileges without logging in as root
Why avoid root login?
	- has unlimited power, high risk of compromise
	- mistakes are irreversible
	- no record of who ran commands
safer to grant sudo access only when necessary (least privilege)

## Key User Commands
useradd: adds new user
usermod: modifies existing user
userdel: deletes user
chown: file ownership for users/groups

## Linux Support
man: displays detailed info about commands
apropos: searches man page for keywords, useful when you dont know command name
whatis: gives one line of description of a command
