# Course 5 – Module 2: Protect Organizational Assets

## Security Controls
- Safeguards designed to reduce risks

# Types of Controls:

- Technical: encryption, MFA, etc.
- Operational: maintaining day-to-day security environments
- Management: policies, standards, procedures

## The Data Lifecycle
-Five Stages: collect, store, use, archive, destroy

# Data Governance:
- set of process outlining how organizations manage information

- Purpose: creates policies to ensure data remains private, accurate, available, secure through its lifecycle

- Key roles:
	• Data Owner: decides who can access, edit, use, destroy information
	• Data Custodian: safe handling, transport, storage of data
	• Data Steward: maintains/implements governance policies

## Cryptography
- transferring information into form that unintended readers cant understand

- Algorithm: set of rules used to solve a problem
- Cipher: algorithm that encrypts information
- Cryptographic Key: mechanism that decrypts ciphertext 

- Brute Force Attack: trial and error process of discovering private information

## Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
- encryption framework that secures the exchange of information online

# PKI Process:
- Exchange of encrypted information
	• Asymmetric Encryption: use of public/private key pair for encryption/decryption of data
	• Symmetric Encryption: use of single secret key to exchange information
- Establish trust using system of Digital Certificates
	• file that verifies identity of public key holder

## Non-repudiation and Hashing

- Hash Function: algorithm that produces code that cant be decrypted
- Non-repudiation: concept that the authenticity of information cant be denied

# Evolution of Hash Functions:
- created to quickly search for data

- How They Work: algorithms represent data of any size as small, fixed-sized values called Digests
	• Hash Tables used to store/reference these values, making data retrieval more efficient/secure

- Message Digest 5 (MD5): used to verify that a file sent over a network matched its source
	• converts data unto 128-bit value, which appears as 32 characters long

- Hash Collisions: vulnerability in hash functions where two different inputs produce same hash value
	• possible becayse there are infinite number of inputs but finite amount of outputs
	• when 2 different inputs produce same hash value

- SHA Family (The Securing Hashing Algorithms): group of functions that create longer hash values to reduce risk of collision
	• family includes SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512

- Secure Password Storage:
	• hashing used to secure passwords in database
	• hash versions of passwords are stored to protect against attacks
	• hash values can NOT be reversed, attackers cant get orignal pw

- Rainbow Tables: files that contain pre-generated hash values for common pw's. Attackers use them to compare agaisnt stolen pw database to find matches

- Salting: security measure that adds a random string of characters (a salt) to data before it is hashed. Makes each has unique

## Access Controls and Authentication Systems

- Access Controls: security controls managing, authorization, and accountability of information

- AAA Framework: Authentication, Authorization, Accounting

- Factors of Authentication:
	• Knowledge: what the user knows
	• Owenership: what the user possesses
	• Characteristics: what the user is

- Single Sign-On (SSO): technology that combines several different logins into one

- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): security measure which requires a user to verify their identity in two or more ways to access a system or network

# How They Work:

- SSO: uses trusted 3rd-party to verify user identity. Achieved through exchange of enxrypted access tokens between the identity provider and the service provider

- Protocols Used:
	• LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol): primarily used for transmitting information on-premises
	• SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language): used for transmitting information off-premises, such as in the cloud

- Benefit: one access token can connect user to multiple applications

- MFA: requires user to verify identity in 2 or more ways to access system/network

- Benefit: effective security measure, especially in cloud environments where remote access is common. Reduces risk of authenticating threat actors by requiring forms of ID difficult to imitate or brute force

# Mechanisms of Authorization:

- Basic Auth: technology used to establish user request to access server

-OAuth: open-standard authorization protocol that shares designated access between applications

- API Token: small block of encrypted code that contains info about user

# Why Audit User Activity:

- Session: sequence of network HTTP basic auth requests/responses associated with the same user

- Session ID: unique token that identifies a user and their device while accessing the system

- Session Cookie: token that websites use to validate a session and determine how long that session would last

- Session Hijacking: event when attackers obtain legitimate user session ID

## Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- collection of processes/technologies to manage digital identity
- IAM and AAA are major models for managing user access

- Goal: authenticate users, determine access privileges, track activities

# Security Fundamentals:

- Two fundamental security principles limit access
	• Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP): limits individual access
	• Separation of Duties (SoD): divides responsibilities among multiple people

# Authenticating Users
- requires proof that user is who they claim to be

- Factors: knowledge, ownership, characteristics

- Tools Used: login credentials, SSO, MFA

- User Provisioning: process of creating/maintaining users digital identity to allow back-end systems to verify information

- User Deprovisioning: remove user access rights when they should no longer have them

# Granting Authorization
- ensures right resources are available after authentication 
- three common frameworks for handling authorization
	• MAC, DAC, RBAC

- Mandatory Access Control (MAC):
	• strictest framework
	• authorization based on strict need-to-know basis
	• access granted manually by central authority/system admin
	• also known as Non-Discretionary Control 
	• commonly used in law enforcement, military, govt agencies

- Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
	• typically applied when a data owner decides appropriate levels of access

- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
	• auth determined by user role within organization

# Access Control Technologies
- tools that offer speed/automation for admins to monitor/modify access rights
- decrease errors/potential risks
- Typical IAM or AAA system consists of:
	• a user directory
	• tools for managing data
	• authorization system
	• auditing system
