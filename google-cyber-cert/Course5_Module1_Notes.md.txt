# Course 5 â€“ Module 1: Introduction to Asset Security

## What, Why, How of Asset Security:

- Asset: anything valuable to organizations
- Why protect: loss/compromise effects CIA

# Asset Classification:

- Public: minimal damage if leaked
- Internal: may cause operational issues if leaked
- Confidential: could harm business if exposed
: Highly confidential/Restricted: critical, need-to-know

## Risks, Threats & Vulnerabilities

- Risk: anything impacting CIA of asset
- Threat: event negatively impacting asset
- Vulnerability: weakness that is exploited by threat

## Assets in a Digital World

# States of Data:
- Data in Use: data accessed by one or more users
- Data in Transit: data travelling from one point to another
- Data at Rest: data not currently accessed

## Cloud Security

# Cloud Based Services

- Software as a Service (SaaS): front-end applications users access through web browser. Service providers host, manage, and maintain all the back-end systems for applications
eg; Gmail email service, Slack, Zoom
- Platform as a Service (PaaS): back-end app development tools client can access online. Developers use resources to write code and build, manage, deploy own apps. CSP hosts/maintains back-end hardware/software apps used to operate
eg; Google App Engine platform, Heroku, VMware Cloud Foundry
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): customers given remote access to range of back-end systems hosted by CSP. includes data processing, servers, storage, networking resources, etc.

# What is Cloud Security?

- Focuses on protecting data, applications, and infrastructure of the cloud
- Uses Shared Responsibility Model
	- CSP Role: responsible for security of servers and infrastructure
	- Clients Role: securing anything they control (Identity/Access Management)
- Varying Responsibilities: division of responsibility depends on type of service being used

# Cloud Security Challenges:

- Misconfiguration: customers responsible for configuring own security environment
- Cloud-native breaches: more likely to occur due to misconfiguration
- Monitoring Access: may be difficult depending on client/level of service
- Meeting Regulatory Standards: HIPAA, PCI DSS, GDPR

## Elements of Security Plans

- Policy: set of rules that reduce risk and protects info
- Standards: references informing how to set policies
- Procedures: step-by-step instructions to perform specific security tasks

## NIST Framework (CSF)
- Voluntary framework consists of standards, guidelines, best practices to manage risks

# NIST CSF Components

- Core: simplified version of functions/ duties of security plan
	- identify, protect, detect, respond, recover
- Tiers: provides security teams with way to measure performance across five functions of core
- Profiles: provde insight into current state of security plan
