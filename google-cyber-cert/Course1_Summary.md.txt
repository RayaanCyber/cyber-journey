# Course 1 – Foundations of Cybersecurity: Summary & Reflection

## What I Learned:

- How cybersecurity protects systems, data, and networks
- The roles of SOC Analysts, GRC Analysts, and Pen Testers
- The CIA Triad and its real-world applications
- The history of major cyberattacks (Target, Equifax, Colonial Pipeline)
- Threats vs. vulnerabilities vs. risk
- Key cybersecurity frameworks (NIST, ISO 27001)

## My Biggest Takeaways:

- Cybersecurity is a team effort — communication matters as much as tools.
- Thinking like an attacker helps you defend better.
- I now understand why continuous learning is critical in this field.
