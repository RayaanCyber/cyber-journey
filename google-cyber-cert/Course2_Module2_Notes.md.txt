### Frameworks 

## Security Frameworks: guidelines for building plans to help mitigate risks/threats to data/privacy
- NIST (CSF)
- ISO/IEC 27001
- CIS Controls

## Controls: safeguards to reduce risks

# Types of Controls:
- Encryption: convert data from readable to encoded format
- Authentication: verify who someone/something is
- Authorization: grant access to specific resources within system 

# Types:
- Preventive: Stop incidents (e.g. firewalls, access control)
- Detective: Find incidents (e.g. IDS, logs)
- Corrective: Fix incidents (e.g. backups, patches)  

# Categories: 
  - Administrative: Policies, awareness training
  - Technical: Software/hardware tools
  - Physical: Locks, fences, surveillance

## CIA Triad

- Confidentiality: protect privacy
- Integrity: ensure accuracy
- Availability: ensure access

## NIST Framework 

# NIST CSF: voluntary framework of standards, guidelines, best practices to manage risk

# 6 core functions
- Govern
- Identify
- Protect
- Detect
- Respond
- Recover

## OWASP
- minimize attack surface area
- principle of least privilege 
- defense in depth
- separation of duties
- keep security simple
- fix security issues correctly

## Security Audit

- Steps:
  1. Plan
  2. Collect info
  3. Analyze gaps
  4. Report & act
